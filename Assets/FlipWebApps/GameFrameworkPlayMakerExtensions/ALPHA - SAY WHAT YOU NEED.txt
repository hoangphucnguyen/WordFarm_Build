Hi,

We are just starting out adding PlayMaker support and this is a very early alpha to show 
the kind of possibilities. If you would like to see additional actions here then please 
get in contact and let us know what you need. We are keen to work with you to quickly 
add additional PlayMaker actions and support.

Contact me directly at mark_a_hewitt@yahoo.co.uk

Regards,
Mark Hewitt
