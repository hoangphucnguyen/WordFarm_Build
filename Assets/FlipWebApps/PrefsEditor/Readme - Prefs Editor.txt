QUICK START

The Prefs Editor window is available through the Unity Editor's Window Menu by selecting the "Prefs Editor" option.

The Prefs Editor window displays a list of all your current PlayerPrefs along with a toolbar that gives you common options 
for manipulating the items. Each PlayerPrefs item displayed shows it's type, followed by options for editing the key
and value, and then buttons to let you save changes or delete the prefs item.

To create a new Player Prefs item select the New... option from the Prefs Editor window and then select the type, key 
and value as you would if creating through the API.

To modify an existing Player Prefs item, update the corresponding key or value and then click the Save, or Save All icons.

To delete an existing Player Prefs item, click the delete icon next to the corresponding entry, or the Delete All... button.

If the PlayerPrefs change, then you will need to click the 'Refresh' button to update the list.

If using encrypted player prefs then enter a unique pass phrase of your choosing (recommended 10+ characters).
